# CSharp-RayTracer
Rebuilding the C++ ray tracer I created during my University Course to practice CSharp.

This project works on both Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

### How to build
From the root folder run ```dotnet build``` or build using Visual Studio 2019+

### How to run
- Windows:
Run the ```CSharp-RayTracer.exe``` from the ```bin/Debug/net5.0``` folder.
- Linux:
Run the command ```dotnet CSharp-RayTracer.dll``` from the ```bin/Debug/net5.0``` folder.
